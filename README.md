This project holds the source code for the diez.org website.  It includes a static site build with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) and a Diez design language used to power it.

### Getting started

You'd need the following to be installed in order to build this project locally:

- Node v10.16.3
- yarn v1.17.3

After cloning, run `yarn install` to install dependencies and set-up the repo as the [setup.sh](./scripts/setup.sh) is run as a preinstall hook.
